    <section class="terms-content">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using TrustX (the "Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Platform. TrustX reserves the right to update these Terms at any time, and your continued use of the Platform constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 18 years old and capable of entering into legally binding contracts to use TrustX. By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements and that all information you provide during registration is accurate and complete.</p>

            <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
            <p>
                3.1. To access certain features of TrustX, you must create an account by providing your email, password, and, optionally, a cryptocurrency wallet address. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.<br>
                3.2. You agree to notify TrustX immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. TrustX will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to secure your account.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Platform Usage</h2>
            <p>
                4.1. TrustX provides a decentralized platform for freelancers and clients to collaborate using blockchain technology and AI-powered verification. You may use the Platform to post projects, offer services, or engage in transactions as a freelancer or client.<br>
                4.2. You agree not to use the Platform for any unlawful or prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud, impersonation, or posting misleading information.<br>
                4.3. TrustX uses AI to verify profiles and detect suspicious activity. You consent to this verification process and acknowledge that TrustX may suspend or terminate your account if fraudulent behavior is detected.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Payments and Escrow</h2>
            <p>
                5.1. All payments on TrustX are processed through smart contracts on the blockchain. Funds are held in escrow until the project is completed and approved by the client.<br>
                5.2. Clients agree to deposit funds into the escrow smart contract before work begins. Freelancers will receive payment only after the client approves the delivered work.<br>
                5.3. TrustX charges a platform fee, which will be deducted from the payment. The fee structure is outlined in the Pricing section of the Platform and may change with prior notice.<br>
                5.4. All transactions are final once approved on the blockchain. Refunds are not possible unless agreed upon by both parties or resolved through dispute resolution.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Ratings and Reviews</h2>
            <p>
                6.1. After project completion, both freelancers and clients may leave ratings and reviews, which are stored immutably on the blockchain.<br>
                6.2. You agree to provide honest and accurate feedback. TrustX reserves the right to remove reviews that violate these Terms, such as those containing offensive language or false information.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                7.1. In the event of a dispute between a freelancer and a client, TrustX provides a decentralized arbitration system to resolve conflicts fairly.<br>
                7.2. Both parties agree to participate in the dispute resolution process in good faith. Decisions made through this process are final and binding.<br>
                7.3. TrustX is not responsible for any losses incurred during a dispute, including delays in payment or project delivery.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                8.1. All content on TrustX, including text, graphics, logos, and software, is the property of TrustX or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.<br>
                8.2. Work delivered through the Platform belongs to the client upon payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the freelancer and client.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                9.1. TrustX provides the Platform "as is" and does not guarantee that it will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.<br>
                9.2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, TrustX will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Platform, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill.<br>
                9.3. TrustX is not responsible for the conduct of users on the Platform, including the quality of work delivered or the accuracy of project postings.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Termination</h2>
            <p>
                10.1. TrustX may suspend or terminate your account at its sole discretion if you violate these Terms or engage in fraudulent or harmful behavior.<br>
                10.2. Upon termination, you will lose access to your account, and any ongoing projects may be canceled. Funds in escrow will be handled according to the dispute resolution process.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert Jurisdiction, e.g., the State of Delaware, USA], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the courts of [Insert Jurisdiction].
